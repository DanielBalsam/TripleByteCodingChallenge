# Triple Byte Coding Challenge
The challenge was to build a Kanban board that could save itself to the server. This project requires an "app.config" file which isn't check into source control because it contains secrets relevant to the database. If you would like to compile and run the server locally, please reach out to me at danielbalsam@gmail.com and I will send you a one time secret with instructions to set up the app.config.

Large node dependency tree is a leftover from me trying to be over-prepared for the challenge. There's also a few things here that I did not need to use, like an S3 integration, that I had prepared in advance because if I did need it that would have been cumbersome to do on the spot.
